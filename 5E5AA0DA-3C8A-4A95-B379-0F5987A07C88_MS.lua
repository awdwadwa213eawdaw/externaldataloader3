--[[ PM from AntiBoomz0r:


For PC/Trainer Battles/Trading:
1. Open a menu window, such as your trainer card.
2. Click the PC/Talk to trainer/accept trade like normal, interacting works even through menus.
3. When the PC is open or the battle/trade has started, close the menu window you have open
4. The side menu opens and you're free to open any of the other menus

For wild pokemon battles/etc.
1.1: If you're fast enough, you can press both the save button and any of the other menu buttons before the side menu retracts completely, opening both of them.
1.2: Otherwise, there's a roblox bug that lets your cursor move off the sides of the screen when roblox is in a maximized window. This lets you open the save dialog and press any of the other menu buttons even when they're offscreen.
2. When both the save dialog and the menu are open, press no to the save dialog
3. You're now free to walk around with the menu open and get into wild pokemon battles
4. When the battle has started, close the menu window you have open
5. The side menu opens and you're free to open any of the other menus

I hope that was clear enough.

If you have more questions, feel free to ask,
Anti
